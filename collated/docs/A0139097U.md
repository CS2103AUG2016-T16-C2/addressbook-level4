Figure 5: UI Class Diagram

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

> * The name of the task/event will be highlighted in blue, if the task or event has only four days left.<br>
> * The name will be highlighted in green, if there are three days left.<br>
> * The name will be highlighted in purple, if there are two days left.<br>

#### Repeating a task: `repeat`
Description: Repeats an index specified task per a user defined schedule.<br>
Format: `repeat INDEX SCHEDUELE`<br>

> Key things to note:<br>
> * The `SCHEDUELE` can either be `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly` or `off`. <br>
> * This means a task can either repeat every next week, month or year to the original deadline of the task till the user inputs off, which would terminate the task repeating. <br>
> * Completing a task that is on repeat will only complete the task for the week.<br>

Examples:
* `list`
  `repeat 3 yearly`
  Repeats the third task on the list every year after the deadline on that date till the user says to stop.
* `find CS2103`
  `repeat 1 monthly`
  Repeats the first task on the CS2103 list every month after the original deadline of the task.
