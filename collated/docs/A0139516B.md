## Introduction

This guide will allow you as a developer to obtain a better understanding of how 'The Practical Task Manager' functions. This task manager was designed based on two main principles, that the user would find it intuitive to use and simple to understand.

## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This application will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE

3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))

4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildship-gradle-integration)


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

#### Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**
* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.
* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:<br>
  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Gradle` -> `Refresh Gradle Project`.

**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.
* Solution: [Run tests using Gradle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).


## Design

```
###### \DeveloperGuide.md
``` md
**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

* `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
* This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
* The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Figure 7 is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>

### Model component

<img src="images/modelDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
Figure 8: Model Class Diagram

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

<img src="images/storageDiagram.jpg" width="800"><br>
Figure 9: Storage Class Diagram

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.


## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file
(default: `config.json`):

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
   These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`

**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

#### Troubleshooting tests
 **Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**
 * Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests.<br>
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
 * Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.


## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 3. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file your created.

### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## About the Task Manager
From Google Calendar to Todoist, Easynote and S Planner, there are many task managers out there that help users like yourself manage their lives more effectively. However, you may have noticed that such task managers often require you to go through a multitude of menu options and clicks before you can even input your activity into the manager. This results in you losing time throughout the day as work piles up with no end in sight and task managers that force you to jump through hoops just to keep track of everything.<br>

So, with that in mind our team designed this task manager to give users like yourself a more hassle-free and efficient experience. We have named this application â€œThe Practical Task Managerâ€? or â€œTPTMâ€? for short.<br>

We believe that TPTM will greatly benefit any user who favours a command line interface and are thus releasing this program to the public to use free of charge. So, if you need a simple application to manage your busy life TPTM is the program for you!<br>

#### Adding a task: `add`
Description: Adds a task to TPTM<br>
Format: `add TASKNAME s/<STARTDATE> d/<DEADLINE> p/<PRIORITY> t/<TAG>...`<br>
Shortcut: `+`

> Key things to note:
> * STARTDATE AND DEADLINE parameters can be in ddmmyy, ddmmyy [HH:MM] or dd-mm-yy [HH:MM] formats.
> * Time must be in the 24-hour format.
> * If no time is specified, STARTDATE will be set to a default value of 00:00 whereas DEADLINE will default to 23:59.
> * Tasks can have different priority levels or none at all (from 1 to 5, where 1 is the highest priority and 5 is the lowest priority).<br>
> * Tasks can have any number of tags (even 0).

Examples:
* `add complete report`<br>
  Adds a floating task named â€˜complete reportâ€™
* `add CS2103 project d/231016 p/1 t/Group`<br>

#### Finding all tasks containing any keyword in their name: `find`
Description: Finds task/s whose names contain any of the specified keywords.<br>
Format: `find KEYWORD <MORE_KEYWORDS>`<br>
Shortcut: `@`

> Key things to note:
> * The search is not case sensitive. e.g. `cs2103t` will match `CS2103T`.<br>
> * The search can be partial. e.g. `CS21` will display `CS2101`, `CS2103T` and `CS2103 Project`.<br>
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Software Engineering` will match `Engineering Software`<br>
> * Only the keywords are searched.<br>

#### Saving TPTMâ€™s current state: `save`
Description: Saves all tasks currently on TPTM to a new file or a previously saved file.<br>
Format: `save ./data/FILE_NAME.xml`

> Key things to note:<br>
> * Name of the file must be be in a `NAME.xml` format only, the `NAME` can be alphanumerical.<br>
> * If the name of the file does not exist in `data` a new file will automatically be created. <br>
> * If the file already exists in `data`, then the saving the state into that file will overwrite the previous information and store the new state in the file. <br>
> * This function serves as the backup tool for TPTM, it is suggested that regular backups be made using this command.

Example:
* `save ./data/backup1.xml`<br>
  Saves the current state of TPTM into a file known as `backup1`.
* `save ./data/jimsLife.xml`<br>
  Saves the current state of TPTM into a file known as `jimsLife`.

> * Follows the same naming convention as `save`.
> * `load` allows the user to load any file that has been saved using TPTM.
> * If the file does not exist no file will be loaded.
> * If load succeeds it will cause TPTM to shut down and upon accessing TPTM again it will reflect the state of the previously loaded file.

Examples:<br>
* `load ./data/backup1.xml`  
   Loads the file previously saved `backup1` into TPTM.
* `load ./data/TomsLife.xml`<br>
  Loads the imported file named `TomsLife` into TPTM.
