## Introduction 

This guide will allow you as a developer to obtain a better understanding of how 'The Practical Task Manager' functions. This task manager was designed based on two main principles, that the user would find it intuitive to use and simple to understand.

### UI component

Figure 5: UI Class Diagram

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

Figure 6 : Logic Class Diagram

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

* `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
* This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
* The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>

### Model component

Figure 8: Model Class Diagram

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
