### Architecture

Figure 1: Architecture Diagram

Figure 1 given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : The component that holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : The location that data is read from and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the Figure 2 given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>

Figure 3 below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 3`.

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskManagerChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

Figure 4 below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

#### Exiting the program : `exit`
Description: Exits the program.<br>
Format: `exit`


#### Saving the data
Task Manager data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.<br>
There is no need to save manually.


## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with
       the file that contains the data of your previous Task Manager folder.
